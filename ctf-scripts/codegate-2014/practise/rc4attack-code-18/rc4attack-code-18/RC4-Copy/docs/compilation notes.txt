Some random notes regarding the compilation of this project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* when using gcc you need to enable c99 with -std=c99
* GLOBALFUNC is a nickname for extern, for future reference. use only when the interface should be exposed
* we will later want to compile algo.c (and its future children) as a shared library
* RC4 implementation should also go into a shared library (RC4 impl should expose an interface for getting S as well)
* main / attack will link against the shared libraries
